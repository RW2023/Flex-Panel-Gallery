## <u>*Description*</u>



The Flex Panel Gallery is a simple image gallery that uses CSS Flexbox and JavaScript to create a smooth and interactive layout. When a panel is clicked, it expands to display additional content while pushing the surrounding panels away. The expanded panel also changes color and font size.
